## Overview

This is the Professional Portfolio for Luke Munsch to demonstrate the technical ability to create, manipulate and use features and pages; Combining multiple languages to produce an assortment of stylised information.

I have built this portfolio using a Django project system as the use of a database for the ever increasing resume of projects will need to be updated and the page automatically rendering the updated content.

## User Stories

The main purpose of my site is for people to see my "CV"; instead of creating a written document solely for people to read, I have built the CV for people to interact with and engage with the content I have included worthy of display.

On further journies to my site, there will be new content as I continue to build content; either as projects for myself or projects I have built for other people, to demonstrate my design and building skills. This will be uploaded to my site and my resume page will grow in accordance with my different projects.

## Features

### Header, Menu and Index Page

I created a simple header element which shows my name, job title and links to the most popular and professional sites; LinkedIn and my CV for download purposes. As I have opted for a colourful background across the main pages, I chose not to have any advanced or conflicting colours for the header; plain black with slightly off white writing, a slightly lighter hover link color compared to the standard which would have been dark blue on a background of black.

The menu I had in mind is a fixed menu at the bottom of the page; similar in style to the header at the top, simple off white writing, but i also wanted to have a clear hover diference, and chose a green hover colour which also has a transition to add some slightly more interesting style to my site.

## Testing
