## Overview

This is the Professional Portfolio for Luke Munsch to demonstrate the technical ability to create, manipulate and use features and pages; Combining multiple languages to produce an assortment of stylised information.

I have built this portfolio using a Django project system as the use of a database for the ever increasing resume of projects will need to be updated and the page automatically rendering the updated content.

## User Stories

The main purpose of my site is for people to see my "CV"; instead of creating a written document solely for people to read, I have built the CV for people to interact with and engage with the content I have included worthy of display.

On further journies to my site, there will be new content as I continue to build content; either as projects for myself or projects I have built for other people, to demonstrate my design and building skills. This will be uploaded to my site and my resume page will grow in accordance with my different projects.
